<p>Definition: <em>Ensuring the software quality is meeting the requirements of the user (and other shareholders)</em></p>
<h2>Quality factors (as defined by ISO 9126:1992)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong><ul>
<li><em>Satisfying stated or implied needs of the software's function</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong><ul>
<li><em>Maintain performance under stated conditions for stated period of time</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Usability</strong><ul>
<li><em>The effort needed for use by a stated or implied set of users</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong><ul>
<li><em>The relationship between performance and resources</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong><ul>
<li><em>The effort needed to make modifications</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Portability</strong><ul>
<li><em>The ability of software to be transferred from one environment to another</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting good software</h2>
<p><strong>Quality assurance</strong> is where the software development process is <strong>managed</strong> to ensure quality. It is a set of <strong>procedures and processes</strong> that make sure software is built the <em>right</em> way. There are general princples but they will be specialised for companies and projects.</p>

<h2>The ISO 9000 Family</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ISO 9000</strong><ul>
<li>Document family guidelines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ISO 9001</strong><ul>
<li>Model for quality assurance in design, development, production, installation and servicing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ISO 9002</strong><ul>
<li>Model for QA in production, installation and servicing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ISO 9003</strong><ul>
<li>Model for QA in final inspection and test</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ISO 9004</strong><ul>
<li>Guidelines on quality management and quality system elements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ISO 9000-3</strong><ul>
<li>Application of ISO 9001 to the development, supply and maintenance of software</li>
<li>There is a direct correspondence between clauses of ISO 9001 and ISO 9000-3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of sections from ISO 9000-3 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management responsibilities</li>
<li>Testing and validation</li>
<li>Document control</li>
<li>Corrective action</li>
</ul>
<h2>ISO 9001 vs ISO 9000-3</h2>
<h3>ISO 9001</h3>
<p>...Quality planning shall be consistent with all other requirements of a supplier’s quality system and shall be documented in a format to suit the supplier's method of operation. The supplier shall give consideration to...</p>
<h3>ISO 9000-3</h3>
<p>Quality planning should address…</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality requirements, expressed in measurable terms, where appropriate;</li>
<li>The life cycle model to be used for software development</li>
<li>Defined criteria for starting and ending each project phase</li>
<li>Identification of types of reviews, tests and other verification and validation activities to be carried out</li>
<li>Identification of configuration management processes to be carried out</li>
</ul>
<h2>Process in a nutshell</h2>
<ol>
<li>Define what is 'good quality'</li>
<li>Define a procedure for verifying this</li>
<li>Carry out said procedure</li>
<li>Record the result</li>
<li>Take and record and corrective action</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>Reviews involve documentation or code being inspected by a group with the aim of finding any bugs or problems. It is usually conducted as a meeting and may involve the <strong>writer, QA, PL and others</strong>. <strong>Reviews are the best way to find bugs</strong>.</p>
<h3>Documents needed for review</h3>
<ul>
<li>The item under review</li>
<li>The documents from which the item is derived<ul>
<li>i.e. For test spec, requirements, UI design, maybe program design</li>
<li>i.e. For code, design document</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The relevant quality plan documents (e.g. SE.QA.__)</li>
<li>A review checklist that summaries what major issues to look for in a quick and easy way</li>
</ul>
<h2>QA Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>QA is the process of doing things in such a way as to ensure that end results meet the users requirements.</li>
<li>Steps must be appropriate &amp; economically realistic.</li>
<li>Aim is <em><strong>not</strong> highest possible quality</em>, but is a compromise between
  – Time
  – Cost
  – Quality
  – Scope</li>
</ul>
