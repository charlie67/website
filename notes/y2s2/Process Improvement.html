<p>There is a direct link between process quality and product quality for manufacturing. The Toyota Way demonstrates this clearly. Software engineering can draw many similarities, given software quality is also dependent on staff skills and experience, budget, time, people, technology etc. Process Improvement is the decomposition of existing processes, measuring their decomposed aspects and seeking to improve those aspects.</p>

<h2>Measuring Processes</h2>
<p>A process is comprised of its input, its output and its roles.</p>

<h5>Mapping the 'roles'</h5>
<h2>Measuring Improvement</h2>
<p>Choose a metric that represents the time and resource to complete the process. e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines of code per person-month</li>
<li>Average defects found in a given review</li>
<li>Branches of code</li>
<li>Time to perform a task</li>
</ul>
<h2>SEI CMM</h2>
<p><strong>SEI CMM</strong> is the Software Engineering Institute's Capability-Maturity Model. Originally made to stop the US DoD getting ripped off, it has developed into a framework that a team's processes can be measured against. It is staged as five levels.</p>
<p>The framework itself is very prescriptive and improvement-oriented, compared to ISO-9000</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1: Initial</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Inexperienced software companies</strong></li>
<li>Unstable, ad-hoc process</li>
<li>Project success relies heavily on staff skills and experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Level 2: Repeatable</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Able to <em>repeat</em> earlier success</strong></li>
<li>Stable project planning</li>
<li>Tracking of important metrics</li>
<li>Project standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Level 3: Defined</strong><ul>
<li><strong>A stable but non-improving state</strong></li>
<li>Stable process model</li>
<li>Full process training program</li>
<li>Entry/exit criteria (The requirements to be met before starting/before finishing a process)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Level 4: Managed</strong><ul>
<li>Management by measurement</li>
<li>Quantitative targets</li>
<li>Productivity and quality measures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Level 5: Optimising</strong><ul>
<li>Commitment to continuous process improvement</li>
<li>Defect prevention</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
